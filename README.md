This archive should extract to a folder called ".conky_conf" in the $HOME directory.
As such, it will be a hidden directory.
To run this Conky config from the $HOME directory, enter the following command:
./.conky_conf/launch_conky.sh
Alternatively, you can launch from elsewhere as follows:
$HOME/.conky_conf/launch_conky.sh

The default settings were designed with the "iss_on_orbit-wallpaper" desktop background image as obtained from here:
http://wallpaperswide.com/iss_on_orbit-wallpapers.html
I used the 1920 x 1080 version in this installation.
I have not included the image with this Conky configuration because I cannot know what screen resolution will be used in your environment.
Also, it is copyrighted material so I am probably not allowed to include it anyway (although it is free for use).

The Nasalization font was obtained from here: http://www.1001fonts.com/search.html?search=Nasalization&x=0&y=0
If this font is not present and not required, then just change every instance of 'Nasalization' in the scripts to a font you do have.
